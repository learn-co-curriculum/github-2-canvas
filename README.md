# GitHub 2 Canvas

## Learning Goals

- Build Canvas lessons from the command line
- Improve the vibes with Python

## Introduction

The current github-to-canvas Ruby gem has caused me enough grief that I have
taken time out of my first build week to rewrite it in Python.

github-2-canvas is still very much under construction, but the functions and
details will be added in as I complete them.

## hello

Connect to Canvas via canvasapi Python package. Return evidence of connection

## convert

Take command line input and convert a markdown file into an HTML file. This
HTML file is saved in the directory from which the command was executed (which
I'm realizing is not very smart).

## create

Does nothing.
